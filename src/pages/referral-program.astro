        <h2>What Is the BlueAlpha Referral Program?</h2>
        <p>
          The BlueAlpha Referral Program rewards partners who connect qualified leads to our marketing measurement and
          automation platform. When your referral becomes a client, you earn <strong>15% commission</strong> on their fees
          during the first 12 months, without affecting their cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The customer’s source is not a pricing variable. Your 15% comes from our margin — never added to the client’s
          price.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Refer Qualified Leads</strong> — Introduce potential clients that meet our criteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>We Evaluate & Close</strong> — We review the referral and notify you if it’s qualified. If it closes,
            we onboard and deliver services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Earn Your Commission</strong> — Receive <strong>15%</strong> of fees for the first 12 months from initial
            invoice. One‑time: paid within 30 days of receipt. Recurring: paid within 30 days of each installment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaborative Referrals</strong> — If multiple parties refer the same lead, commissions are split equally.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What qualifies as a "qualified lead"?</h3>
        <p>
          A lead that meets BlueAlpha’s fit criteria, determined solely by our team. We’ll notify you upon acceptance.
        </p>
        <h3>How are commissions calculated?</h3>
        <p>
          You earn <strong>15% of fees</strong> paid by your referred client during the first 12 months following their initial
          invoice. Applies to one‑time and recurring payments.
        </p>
        <h3>How much can I earn?</h3>
        <p>
          With our premium contracts, it’s common to receive <strong>$9,000+</strong> per successful referral. There’s no
          cap.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you charge referred clients more?</h3>

        <h3>Can multiple referrers share credit?</h3>
        <p>
