      'Beehiiv, a fast-growing newsletter platform, faced uncertainty over whether its marketing spend was truly incremental. By partnering with BlueAlpha for rigorous incrementality testing across channels like YouTube, Meta, LinkedIn, and TikTok, they uncovered significant discrepancies in platform-reported CPAs. This allowed Beehiiv to reallocate its budget to the most efficient channels.',
