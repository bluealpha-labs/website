## About BlueAlpha

BlueAlpha is rewriting how marketing technology is engineered. We're building an AI-native operating system where specialized agents handle optimizations across massive, heterogeneous datasets. This requires unifying data pipelines, applied machine learning, and autonomous decision-making into a seamless system. As the founding team, we challenge ideas, share openly, and strive for excellence without ego. If you want to push agentic AI beyond the lab and into production at scale, this is your chance.

## Role Overview

We're hiring our **first Product Designer** to define how marketers interact with AI-native products where the rules haven't been written yet. You'll work closely with founders, engineers, and early customers to translate messy, ambiguous workflows into intuitive, delightful experiences. From zero-to-one prototypes to polished systems, you'll be the voice of the customer inside BlueAlpha—ensuring usability, clarity, and trust in products that challenge how marketing has always worked.

This role is both strategic and hands-on: you'll establish our design vision, own the design system, lead user research, and lay the foundation for a future design team. Your work won't just shape the look and feel of BlueAlpha—it will define how marketers and AI collaborate.

## Responsibilities

- Lead design across the entire product lifecycle, from framing vague problems to delivering high-fidelity solutions
- Drive user research and discovery to deeply understand marketer pain points and test hypotheses quickly
- Translate complex AI and data workflows into clear, usable, and trustworthy interfaces
- Build and maintain the BlueAlpha design system for consistency and speed
- Partner closely with product and engineering to align design strategy with technical realities
- Establish the design culture—how we critique, collaborate, and put the customer first—and scale it as we grow

## Qualifications

### Required

- 4+ years designing complex software products, ideally in data, AI, or enterprise contexts
- Portfolio showing excellence in UX/UI and interaction design, with examples of simplifying complexity
- Strength in user research, prototyping, and storytelling—bringing clarity to abstract problems
- Comfort working without a playbook—able to self-direct and create structure in ambiguity
- Excited about shaping how AI-native products should look and behave (not just applying existing UI patterns)

### Big Plus

- Experience designing for technical B2C audiences (consumer analytics, consumer fintech, or consumer tech/ML)
- Comfort with front-end development or design-to-code workflows
- Experience building or scaling design systems in a startup context

## Compensation & Benefits

- **Compensation**: competitive salary + meaningful equity — real ownership in BlueAlpha's success
- **Benefits**: health insurance, flexible PTO, and remote-friendly work
- **Growth**: Build the design culture from the ground up and grow into a leadership role as the team scales
- **Culture**: A collaborative, high-energy environment where we challenge ideas, not people — small team, big ambition
- **Impact**: Founding designer shaping the look, feel, and usability of AI-native products used by leading marketing teams. Your fingerprints will be on everything customers touch
