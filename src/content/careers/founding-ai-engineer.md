# About BlueAlpha

BlueAlpha is pioneering AI-first marketing automation—a platform built to deliver unbiased measurement, intelligent automation, and real-world impact. Founded by former Tesla data scientists and engineers, we're building a system that does the hard work behind the scenes so brands can scale profitably, without guesswork.

# About the Role

As our Founding AI Engineer, you'll architect and implement the AI driving our measurement and optimization systems. You will:

- Build AI-powered agents that automate marketing decisions—from budget allocation to messaging strategies
- Design and deploy causal inference and incrementality testing models (e.g., GeoLift, synthetic control, MMM)
- Tackle high-dimensional, noisy marketing data to surface real-time, actionable insights
- Collaborate with engineering and data-science teams to productionize sophisticated models
- Own research and experimentation to keep BlueAlpha at the cutting edge of AI in marketing

# What You’ll Do

- Develop and deploy ML systems for incrementality, budget allocation, and performance modeling
- Code scalable, production-ready using Python, including frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX
- Structure and process large marketing datasets to feed AI agents and causal models
- Collaborate closely with UI engineers, product designers, and data scientists for seamless integration
- Lead experimentation and validation of new AI techniques tailored to real-world marketing needs

# You May Be a Good Fit If You

- Have 3+ years in applied ML/AI roles, industry or research
- Demonstrated experience with production ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX)
- Strong statistical background—familiarity with causal inference, experimental design, MMM is a major plus
- Experience deploying ML at scale: APIs, model-serving pipelines, CI/CD for ML
- Comfort working in high-ambiguity, high-impact environments—where iteration matters deeply
- Passion for building AI that directly powers business outcomes
