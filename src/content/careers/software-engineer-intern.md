## About BlueAlpha

BlueAlpha is rewriting how marketing technology is engineered. We're building an AI-native operating system where specialized agents handle optimizations across massive, heterogeneous datasets. This requires unifying data pipelines, applied machine learning, and autonomous decision-making into a seamless system. As the founding team, we challenge ideas, share openly, and strive for excellence without ego. If you want to push agentic AI beyond the lab and into production at scale, this is your chance.

## Role Overview

We're looking for a **Software Engineering Intern** to join our team and help design the future of AI-native marketing tools. As an intern, you'll work closely with our engineers and founders to prototype and ship features that make our models usable, intuitive, and impactful for customers. You'll gain hands-on experience across the stack—from frontend interfaces to backend services—while learning how early-stage startups move from idea to product in weeks, not months.

This internship is ideal for someone who's curious, scrappy, and eager to learn by building. You won't just shadow—you'll write code, contribute to live features, and see how AI gets applied in production.

## Responsibilities

- Contribute to building and testing new product features alongside our engineering team
- Help design simple, intuitive user experiences for complex AI workflows
- Debug, document, and improve existing systems (frontend, backend, or infra depending on skills)
- Participate in code reviews and learn best practices from experienced engineers
- Collaborate with Sales and Product to understand user needs and iterate quickly

## Qualifications

### Required

- Proficiency with JavaScript/React or another modern frontend framework
- Some experience with a backend language (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with relational databases like Postgres/MySQL
- Strong problem-solving skills and eagerness to learn in a fast-paced startup environment

### Nice to Have

- Interest in AI/ML (no direct experience required)
- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Prior internship, project, or hackathon experience building usable products

## Compensation & Benefits

- **Compensation**: competitive internship pay (salary or stipend + equity option depending on fit)
- **Benefits**: flexible PTO, remote-friendly setup (health insurance for longer internships)
- **Impact**: chance to ship real features that customers actually use
- **Culture**: collaborative, high-energy, low-ego environment with ambitious builders
