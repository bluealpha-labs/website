## About BlueAlpha

BlueAlpha is rewriting how marketing technology is engineered. We're building an AI-native operating system where specialized agents handle optimizations across massive, heterogeneous datasets. This requires unifying data pipelines, applied machine learning, and autonomous decision-making into a seamless system. As the founding team, we challenge ideas, share openly, and strive for excellence without ego. If you want to push agentic AI beyond the lab and into production at scale, this is your chance.

## Role Overview

We're hiring our **first GTM Engineer** — the powerhouse of BlueAlpha's go-to-market function. This role sits at the intersection of engineering, product, and sales. You'll partner directly with the founders to prototype and ship high-impact solutions that help customers see value faster, close deals, and expand usage.

This is not a "back office" role. You'll be in the trenches with Sales and Product, designing integrations, building custom workflows, and shipping tools that make our AI-native platform click with customers. You'll move quickly from 0→1, often building things that don't exist yet, and your fingerprints will be all over how BlueAlpha reaches and retains its earliest customers.

## Responsibilities

- Build prototypes, integrations, and customer-facing tools that accelerate adoption and time-to-value
- Work directly with founders, Sales, and Product to identify customer pain points and build for them
- Own the GTM engineering toolkit: from demos to custom workflows to internal automations
- Translate customer feedback into product improvements and new use cases
- Be the technical force that powers the entire GTM function at BlueAlpha

## Qualifications

### Required

- 3–6+ years of experience as a software/product engineer, ideally in fast-paced startups
- Fluency in Python or JavaScript and comfort building full-stack prototypes
- Excited to work closely with customers and GTM teams, not just code in isolation
- Enjoy shaping 0→1 products in ambiguous, fast-moving environments
- Founder mindset: scrappy, high-ownership, and motivated by impact

### Big Plus

- Experience with AI/ML APIs, martech/adtech, or building integrations for B2B SaaS

## Compensation & Benefits

- **Compensation**: competitive salary + meaningful equity — real ownership in BlueAlpha's success
- **Benefits**: health insurance, flexible PTO, and remote-friendly work
- **Impact**: Founding GTM engineer, with outsized influence on customer experience and revenue growth
- **Growth**: Shape and eventually scale the GTM engineering function as BlueAlpha grows
- **Culture**: A collaborative, high-energy environment where we challenge ideas, not people — small team, big ambition
