## What Is the BlueAlpha Referral Program?

The BlueAlpha Referral Program rewards partners who connect qualified leads to our marketing measurement and automation platform. When your referral becomes a client, you earn **15% commission** on their fees during the first 12 months, without affecting their cost.

The customer's source is not a pricing variable. Your 15% comes from our margin — never added to the client's price.

## How It Works

1. **Refer Qualified Leads** — Introduce potential clients that meet our criteria.
2. **We Evaluate & Close** — We review the referral and notify you if it's qualified. If it closes, we onboard and deliver services.
3. **Earn Your Commission** — Receive **15%** of fees for the first 12 months from initial invoice. One‑time: paid within 30 days of receipt. Recurring: paid within 30 days of each installment.
4. **Collaborative Referrals** — If multiple parties refer the same lead, commissions are split equally.
