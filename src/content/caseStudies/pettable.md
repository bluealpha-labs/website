title: 'How Pettable Achieved a 14% CAC Reduction by Partnering with BlueAlpha'
description: "When Google Search spend crept past break-even and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) climbed 20%, Pettable's marketing team needed facts, not hunches: Which dollars were truly incremental, and which were cannibalizing organic sales? Existing dashboards couldn't prove causality at the campaign level."

## Fast Facts

![Pettable Fast Facts](#/assets/case-studies/pettable/key-metrics-overview.webp)

- **Industry**: Digital Health / Pet Services
- **Challenge**: 20% CAC increase threatening unit economics
- **Solution**: Geo-based incrementality testing across channels
- **Timeline**: 6-week test period
- **Result**: 14% CAC reduction, $1.2M in found revenue

## The Situation

Pettable was facing a critical inflection point. After years of profitable growth, their Customer Acquisition Cost had climbed 20% in just three months. Google Search—their largest channel—was showing break-even ROAS in their attribution dashboards.

The leadership team was considering drastic cuts to paid search spend, but the Head of Growth suspected their measurement was missing something crucial: **true incrementality**.

## The Challenge

Pettable's existing measurement stack included:

- Google Ads attribution (last-click)
- GA4 multi-touch attribution
- Internal data warehouse with custom attribution
- Post-purchase surveys

Despite this sophisticated setup, they couldn't answer the fundamental question: **Which marketing dollars were creating new customers versus capturing existing demand?**

The stakes were high:

- Cutting Google Search could save $400K/month
- But if those customers were truly incremental, it could cost them $1.2M in revenue
- They needed certainty, not educated guesses

## BlueAlpha's Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnostic MMM

We started with a lightweight Marketing Mix Model to understand the baseline relationship between spend and conversions across all channels. This revealed:

- Google Search showed strong correlation with organic search trends
- Meta campaigns had unexpectedly high baseline contribution
- Email remarketing was likely cannibalizing organic conversions

### Phase 2: Geo-Experimentation Design

Based on the MMM insights, we designed a comprehensive geo-testing framework:

**Test Structure:**

- **Duration**: 6 weeks (September 1 - October 15, 2024)
- **Geo Split**: 210 DMAs split into test/control groups
- **Channels Tested**: Google Search (Brand & Non-brand), Meta Prospecting, TikTok
- **Holdout Design**: Strategic spend reduction in test geos to measure lift

**Key Innovation:** We used synthetic control matching to account for seasonality and market-specific trends, ensuring clean incrementality reads despite Pettable's volatile demand patterns.

## The Results

### Google Search: The Hidden Hero

Despite showing near-breakeven ROAS in dashboards:

- **True incremental ROAS**: 3.8x (vs. 1.1x reported)
- **Incremental CAC**: $42 (vs. $118 platform-reported)
- **Revenue Impact**: $1.2M in previously unattributed conversions

### Meta: The Over-Credited Channel

- **Platform-reported ROAS**: 2.4x
- **True incremental ROAS**: 0.9x
- **Action**: Reduced spend by 40%, reallocated to Google

### TikTok: The Dark Horse

- **Platform-reported CAC**: $95
- **True incremental CAC**: $38
- **Action**: 3x increase in budget

## Implementation & Impact

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2):

1. Restored Google Search budgets to previous levels
2. Shifted 40% of Meta budget to TikTok
3. Implemented incrementality-adjusted bidding strategies

### Results After 30 Days:

- **Overall CAC**: Decreased from $85 to $73 (-14%)
- **Revenue**: Increased by 22% month-over-month
- **Efficiency**: ROAS improved from 1.4x to 1.9x

### Long-term Framework:

BlueAlpha helped Pettable implement:

- Quarterly geo-holdout testing cadence
- Real-time incrementality dashboard
- Automated budget reallocation based on incremental performance

## Key Learnings

1. **Platform Attribution Lies—In Both Directions**
   Google was under-reporting value while Meta was over-claiming credit.

2. **Incrementality Changes Everything**
   Decisions based on platform metrics alone would have killed Pettable's best channel.

3. **Testing Pays for Itself**
   The 6-week test cost $50K to run but generated $300K in monthly savings.

4. **Speed Matters**
   Getting answers in 6 weeks vs. 6 months meant capturing Q4 seasonality optimally.

## What's Next

Pettable is now working with BlueAlpha to:

- Expand testing to creative-level incrementality
- Build predictive models for CAC by cohort
- Implement automated budget allocation across 15+ campaigns
