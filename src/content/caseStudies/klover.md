title: "How Klover Unlocked Millions in 30 Days by Measuring True Marketing Incrementality"
description: "In 30 days, Klover replaced attribution noise with causal truth and made decisive moves: 50% pullback on Meta iOS with steady conversions, 10x scale on Apple Search Ads with lift intact, and 35% better incremental CAC for a clear path to 7-figure savings."

  quote: "BlueAlpha's platform gave us the confidence to make bold budget cuts we'd been hesitating on. Seeing Meta's diminishing returns validated with data, we reduced spend by 50% without losing conversions. That freed up budget to scale Apple Search Ads where we're seeing real incremental growth."

*Categories:* **Incrementality Testing**, **Marketing Mix Modeling**

## **Fast Facts**

- **Industry:** Fintech / Consumer Mobile App (Cash Advance Service)
- **Challenge:** Unreliable attribution obscuring true channel contribution, risking misallocation across paid media
- **Solution:** Always-on MMM anchored with incrementality tests to quantify real lift and guide mix shifts
- **Timeline:** First insights in the first week; major optimizations within 30 days
- **Results:**
    - Meta iOS spend reduced **~50%** with **no measurable loss** in conversions
    - Apple Search Ads scaled by **~10x** while **remaining incremental**
    - Incremental CAC improved by **35%**
    - Material improvement in efficiency and a path to **7‑figure annualized savings**

## The Situation

Klover, a cash-advance mobile app with a multi-million-dollar monthly paid media budget, lacked confidence in platform-reported metrics after privacy changes. The team needed causal, channel-level clarity to decide where additional dollars were truly incremental.

## The Challenge

Platform dashboards looked healthy across channels, yet internal signals suggested diminishing returns at higher spend levels. Two core questions framed the pilot with BlueAlpha:

- Was Meta iOS still driving **incremental** conversions at prior scale, or had it hit diminishing returns?
- Could Apple Search Ads be scaled well beyond prior levels **while maintaining incrementality**?

## BlueAlpha's Approach

### Phase 1: Rapid Integration and Baseline MMM (Week 1)

BlueAlpha ingested two years of historical spend and conversions across a dozen-plus channels and produced calibrated response curves. Early reads indicated **diminishing returns** on Meta iOS at higher spend and **headroom** on Apple Search Ads.

### Phase 2: Incrementality Test Calibration (Weeks 2-3)

Recent geo-lift results were used as priors in the MMM so that modeled contributions reflected **causal lift** observed in-market:

- Meta iOS demonstrated **strong incrementality** at lower-to-moderate levels during testing (~85%)
- TikTok iOS exhibited **measurable but lower** incrementality (~48%)

### Phase 3: Channel-Specific Optimization (Weeks 3-4)

With calibrated curves, Klover executed two coordinated moves:

- **Meta iOS:** cut spend **~50%** to bring investment back into the efficient zone
- **Apple Search Ads:** scale aggressively (**~10x growth**) while monitoring incremental response

### Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring and Refinement (Weeks 5-6)

As the plan rolled out, BlueAlpha provided weekly readouts comparing realized outcomes to model predictions. The data confirmed **stable conversion volume** through the Meta reductions and **incremental growth** from the Apple scale-up. Apple was split into **Brand vs Non-Brand** to enable finer-grained control as volumes rose.

## Results

**Meta iOS Optimization:**

- **Spend:** reduced **~50%**
- **Volume:** **no material decline** in weekly conversions
- **Efficiency:** **double-digit** improvement in cost per incremental conversion (iCPA)
- **Impact:** on a run-rate basis, these changes point to **7‑figure annualized savings**

**Apple Search Ads Scaling:**

- **Scale:** grew **by ~10x** while remaining **incremental**
- **Incrementality:** positive lift maintained throughout scaling
- **Structure:** split into **Brand vs Non-Brand** to preserve efficiency at higher volumes

**Overall Impact (Pilot Window):**

- **Spend quality improved:** more dollars flowing to incremental media
- Conversions: increased by **8%** compared with the pre-optimization baseline
- Economics: incremental CAC improved by **35%** as waste was removed
- **ROI on BlueAlpha investment achieved in first 14 days**

## Key Takeaways

- Platform-reported metrics can overstate contribution at high spend levels. MMM aligned with experiment readouts is a reliable way to detect and correct diminishing returns.
- Cutting back where curves flatten and doubling down where curves are steep can unlock millions in annualized savings while preserving growth.
- Integrating experiment priors into MMM provides an auditable bridge between causality and scaled media planning.

## What's Next

- Launch a Google Android UAC holdout test to quantify incremental lift and set efficient spend bounds
- Continue brand vs non-brand optimization on Apple Search Ads
- Expand always-on testing to additional channels and creatives while MMM tracks marginal efficiency
