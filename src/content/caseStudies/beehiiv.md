## Challenge Context

Amid aggressive growth across **5+ platforms** and **30+ campaigns**, Beehiiv faced significant budget cuts and growing uncertainty about whether acquisition efforts were truly incremental or merely capturing organic sign‑ups.

## The Challenge

Conflicting metrics from platform reports, GA4, internal attribution, and surveys obscured which channels **actually** drove incremental growth. Without clear, data‑driven insight, Beehiiv risked:

- **Overspending** on channels whose reported CPA looked artificially low.
- **Underspending** on channels where CPA was _actually_ favorable but looked high.

The result? Inefficient budget allocation and missed growth opportunities.

## The Solution — BlueAlpha's Two‑Pronged Approach

### 1. Marketing Mix Model (MMM) Analysis

**What We Did**

- Analyzed channel performance to separate high‑ from low‑value efforts.
- Identified confounding factors in traditional attribution.
- Prioritized channels for immediate incrementality testing.

**Why It Matters**
Traditional MMMs are often over‑engineered. BlueAlpha refined the model and paired it with **time‑sensitive incrementality tests** for faster, clearer insights.

### 2. Structured Incrementality Testing

**Experiment Design**

- **Channels Tested**: YouTube, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok
- **Duration**: 6‑week test + 1‑week post‑treatment window
- **Focus**: True incremental **cost per signup** & **cost per paid conversion**; interaction between free‑tier signups and paid‑plan conversions

**Execution**
For each channel, BlueAlpha compared the platform‑reported CPA to the **incremental CPA** revealed by testing (the "BlueAlpha Results").

## The BlueAlpha Results

### Incremental Signups (Free‑Tier Users)

| Channel  | Incremental vs. Platform‑Reported CPA |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TikTok   | ~10% difference — nearly identical    |
| YouTube  | True CPA ≈ **50% higher**             |
| Meta     | True CPA **345% higher**              |
| LinkedIn | Inconclusive — needs more data        |

### Paid‑Plan Conversions

| Channel        | Incremental Insights                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YouTube & Meta | Despite higher signup CPAs, incremental **cost per paid conversion** was **80% lower** than Beehiiv's internal threshold. |
| TikTok         | Remained the most efficient channel, delivering conversions at a cost **≈95% lower** than platform‑reported CPA.          |
| LinkedIn       | Inconclusive — further testing required.                                                                                  |

## Discussion

Relying solely on platform metrics hides the _real_ cost of acquisition:

- Channels like **Meta** can **underreport CPA**, leading to overspending.
- Channels like **TikTok** may look expensive but deliver outsized incremental value.

With BlueAlpha's insights, Beehiiv reallocated budget toward channels that **truly drive incremental growth**, boosting overall efficiency.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data‑Driven Baseline**
   An incremental baseline is more accurate than traditional MMMs alone.

2. **Channel Differentiation**
   TikTok excelled; Meta's CPA was dramatically underestimated.

3. **Informed Budget Allocation**
   Spend can now be optimized, avoiding misleading CPAs.

4. **Continuous Optimization**
   Ongoing testing is crucial—especially for channels like LinkedIn.

## What's Next for Beehiiv?

- **Scale Proven Channels**: Double‑down on TikTok, YouTube, and Meta with refined budgets.
- **LinkedIn Reassessment**: Run larger, longer‑term tests to unlock its potential.
- **Continuous Refinement**: Use the incremental baseline to steer future marketing investments as market conditions evolve.
