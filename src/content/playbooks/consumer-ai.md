## Why this playbook exists

This guide is for Directors and VPs of Marketing / Growth building **consumer-facing AI SaaS**.

Funding is tightening, model launches arrive monthly, and a single bad attribution call can vaporize half this quarter’s budget. Boards still ask for market-share stories, yet the numbers that justify spend live in five ad dashboards, three product tools, and a spreadsheet no one trusts.

This playbook equips you to turn that mess into a repeatable growth engine. You will learn how to:

1. **Translate marketing signals into finance-ready language** so the investors and the CFO can green-light bigger bets.
2. **Diagnose and fix attribution and channel cannibalization** with MMMs and incrementality tests, ending the guesswork about which half of the ad budget is wasted.
3. **Run 10+ experiments each week** without drowning in data sprawl, then scale only the touches that are provably incremental.

It draws on real benchmarks, live examples, and BlueAlpha’s first-principles measurement framework, letting you spend with confidence today and compound gains through 2027.

## The 2025 landscape and the “why now” moment

- **Funding is melting into a few giants.** Q1 2025 broke records with $66.6 billion flowing into AI, yet 79% of that capital sat in mega-rounds at infra vendors, leaving consumer apps to scrap for the rest.
- **New entrants flood the shelves.** Seventeen fresh web products cracked [a16z’s Top 100 Gen-AI](https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps-4/) list in just six months.
- **User expectations leap each model cycle.** ChatGPT doubled from 200M to 400M weekly actives in under six months after GPT-4o voice rolled out .
- **Marketing waste is compounding.** Median CAC pay-back stretched past two years for average SaaS brands in 2024 (source: [Bantrr](https://bantrr.com/business-model/saas-metrics/cac-payback-benchmarks-for-saas-companies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Fail to operationalize incrementality-based growth loops now and you risk a price-warred, churn-heavy future.

## Situation analysis

### Market overview

- **Revenue pool:** Global consumer AI software will top **$32 billion ARR by 2026** ([Menlo Ventures forecast](https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-the-state-of-consumer-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), June 2025).
- **Growth:** 48% CAGR 2023-2025 for consumer AI apps tracked by Similarweb in a16z Top 100.

## Success definition

You need clear finish lines so the CFO signs the cheques and the team sees progress.

Below are entry and exit criteria for each phase. A phase is only 'done' when it removes a pain point and advances a strategic objective. Entry and exit gates are hard numbers, not vibes. The numbers reflect 2025 consumer AI SaaS benchmarks.

| Phase                          | Pain point resolved                                                                            | Objective served              | Entry gate                | Exit gate                                                                                                                     | Leading metrics                |

**Finance Lens**

1. Pricing moves to outcome units, not seats. ElevenLabs tweaked ladders seven times in 40 days; Salesforce adopted outcome-based pricing with Agentforce’s $2 per conversation and Flex Credits models.
2. 'ARR + annualized usage' replaces single ARR rows.
3. GPU cost per active user exposes margin leaks in real time.
4. Databricks feeds live telemetry into an AI forecast model, not Excel sheets.

## Deep-dive instructions

### Phase 1 - Discovery

_Pain point addressed_

Churn hidden in growth

_Why it matters_

You cannot optimize what you cannot name. A clear demand map focuses limited tokens and GPU cycles.

_Inputs_

Analytics event stream, customer interviews (10 × 15 min), refund tags.

_RACI_

**R** Data analyst; **A** Growth Manager; **C** Support lead; **I** VP Eng.

_Steps_

1. Export last 60 days events; run Pareto on time-to-value.
2. Conduct five in-app polls to capture intent; tag JTBD.
3. Cluster qualitative answers using thematic AI (e.g., GPT-4o) to surface JTBD; isolate top 5 churn drivers.
4. Present findings in 15-slide memo.

_Quality checklist_

- At least 200 survey responses
- Clusters explain 80% of churn reasons

_Outputs_ → Insight memo, updated taxonomy.

_KPIs_ → Survey completion, activation time delta.

### Phase 2 - Segmentation

_Pain point addressed_

Personalization debt

_Goal_

Turn raw insights into monetizable personas.

_Inputs_

Event taxonomy, JTBD clusters, spend cohorts.

_RACI_

**R** Data science; **A** VP Growth; **C** Product design; **I** Support.

_Broad steps_

1. Use BlueAlpha to build a RFM (recency-frequency-monetary) table.
2. Layer JTBD tags.
3. Compute LTV distribution; flag top decile.
4. Draft persona pages; align each persona with messaging & value prop.

_Checklist_

- Segments mutually exclusive & collectively exhaustive
- LTV spread >4× between top and bottom quartile.

_Typical duration_ → 2 weeks.

_Outputs_ → Persona one-pagers.

_KPIs_ → LTV spread, segment coverage.

### Phase 3 - Experimentation

_Pain point addressed_

Data sprawl & slow tests

_RACI_

**R** Experiment owner; **A** Head of Growth; **C** Data science; **I** Legal (for privacy).

### **3A. Rapid-cycle tests**

_Goal →_ Find small wins fast: pricing copy, UX tweaks, creative angles.

_Cadence →_ ≥ 10 per week.

_Tooling →_ In-app A/B platform, feature flags.

_Steps_

1. Pull backlog ideas into a Kanban board every Monday.
2. Pre-register goal + MDE; design runs 1–3 days.
3. Deploy to 100 % when lift > 2 % and p < 0.05.
4. Log result in BlueAlpha test ledger.

### 3B. Incrementality tests (GeoLift / MMM refresh)

_Goal →_ Answer strategic spend questions (e.g. “What is YouTube really worth after cannibalization?”)

_Cadence →_ **1-2 tests per month** (2-3 weeks runtime for each test).

_Tooling →_ BlueAlpha GeoLift wizard + BlueAlpha Bayesian MMM.

_Steps_

1. Frame a question tied to budget action (e.g. shift 20% from Meta to TikTok).
2. BlueAlpha selects for you geo clusters large enough for 80% power.
3. Freeze other media variables in test regions to reduce confounds.
4. Run test 21 days; BlueAlpha updates MMM priors with lift estimate.
5. If incremental ROAS delta > +15%, move spend; if negative, pause.
6. Close the loop: document action and measured impact.

_Quality checklist_

- No overlapping incrementality tests in adjacent DMAs.
- Post-test decision written before the test starts.
- Lift fed back into MMM the same day results lock.

![Incrementality tests](#/assets/playbooks/consumer-ai/tests.webp)

> **Best practice:** Run lots of cheap tests, but treat incrementality tests like capital projects. Two high-confidence GeoLift studies per month drive more margin than twenty guess-and-check budget tweaks.

**Benchmarks & dashboards**
Your dashboard template should show separate panels: **Rapid tests** on the left, **GeoLift tests** on the right, so executives see both the volume of learning and the big dollar shifts.

![Tests dashboard](#/assets/playbooks/consumer-ai/tests-dashboard.webp)

### Phase 4 - Spend orchestration

_Pain point addressed_

Attribution & channel cannibalization

_Goal_

Move dollars to highest marginal lift.

_Inputs_

Unified channel-cost (or campaign-cost) table, BlueAlpha Bayesian MMM with time-varying betas.

_RACI_

**R** Media buyer; **A** VP Growth / CMO; **C** Finance lead; **I** CEO.

_Steps_

1. BlueAlpha MMM runs weekly, fitting last 1-2 years of data; coefficients auto-update.
2. GeoLift test outputs weight recent betas higher than old ones, preventing cannibalization bias.
3. BlueAlpha recommends budget reallocation when incremental ROAS delta >15%.
4. Freeze budgets if CAC pay-back rises above 8 months.

_Checklist_

- Attribution error <10% vs. hold-out
- Spend shift executed by 9AM each Monday

_Outputs_ → Spend rebalancing log, incrementality dashboard.

_KPIs_ → CAC pay-back, marginal ROAS.

### Phase 5 - Review & control

_Pain point addressed_

Resource squeeze

_Goal_

Institutionalize what worked, sunset what did not.

_Inputs_

All test logs, KPI dashboards, finance actuals.

_RACI_

**R** Ops analyst; **A** VP Growth; **C** Board observers; **I** Growth PM.

_Steps_

1. Auto-generate Growth Audit from BlueAlpha dashboard: North Star Metric trend, KPI ladder, cash burn.
2. Map tests to financial impact → cumulative incremental ARR by channel/campaign.
3. Set next-quarter OKRs; archive orphan road-map items.

![MMM GeoLift stack](#/assets/playbooks/consumer-ai/mmm-geolift-stack.webp)

_Checklist_

- Audit delivered 5 days before board
- Less than 15 slides

_Outputs_ → QBR deck, updated OKRs.

_KPIs_ → Audit completion on time, board satisfaction score.

**Dashboard design**

_Top row →_ NRR, 90-day retention, CAC pay-back.

_Second row →_ Test velocity, win rate.

_Third row →_ Cash runway, burn multiple.

| CAC pay-back > 10 months in Phase 4     | Re-run channel incrementality test. Cut bottom quartile creatives. Cut spend on channels with <1.5 incremental ROAS |
| Test win rate <15% in Phase 3           | Review hypothesis quality; enforce pre-registration; raise minimum detectable effect.                               |
| NRR <100% at Phase 5 review             | Trigger expansion nudges tied to power-user milestones.                                                             |
