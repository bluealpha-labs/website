> Executive summary

- Traditional MMMs often mis-estimate ROI due to fixed parameters, static priors, and constant betas that ignore how channel effectiveness evolves.
- CMOs risk misallocating millions because most MMMs lack causal validation and dynamic adjustment.
- BlueAlpha’s approach integrates incrementality tests and time‑varying coefficients into a Bayesian MMM, improving accuracy and actionability.
- Workflow: run targeted incrementality tests; use results to locally update MMM betas; iterate continuously.

## MMM alone can’t prove what’s working

MMMs offer a macro view but struggle with causality at granular levels. Incrementality tests (e.g., GeoLift) provide local, time‑sensitive causal signals that anchor the MMM.

## 5 warning signs your current MMM is misleading you

1. No incrementality testing.
2. Static channel effectiveness (constant betas).
3. Overvalued high‑spend channels.
4. Diminishing returns despite model recommendations.
5. Low team trust in outputs.

## Unpacking Bayesian MMMs

### Priors: powerful but perilous

Overly strong priors can dominate sparse data. Prefer looser priors and let the likelihood speak; allow the system to calibrate.

### Inputs: spend, impressions, or GRPs?

- Spend → ties directly to ROI.
- GRPs → cross‑market comparability for offline.
- Impressions/clicks → actual exposure but inconsistent across channels.

Choose based on the decision you’re making (finance vs. reach).

### Scope: decide what you’re modeling

Single product vs. portfolio; purchases vs. signups. Scope determines interpretability and bias.

### MCMC: why it matters and the trade‑offs

MCMC produces distributions, not point estimates; you quantify uncertainty. Costs: compute time and setup expertise.

### The critical flaw: static betas

Standard MMMs hold one coefficient per channel over the entire period. Reality shifts: seasonality, creative fatigue, competition, macro factors. Use time‑varying betas (state‑space / DLM) to model dynamics.

## Where incrementality tests come in

Integrate GeoLift or similar tests to validate and locally update channel effects in the windows where you tested. The MMM remains the orchestrator; tests provide high‑fidelity anchors.

## Practical integration workflow

1. Identify a spend question (e.g., reallocate 20% from Meta to TikTok).
2. Run GeoLift with sufficient power; freeze confounds in test regions.
3. Feed lift into MMM as a stronger local update in that period/context.
4. Repeat across channels/markets to create piecewise‑anchored time‑varying betas.

## Benefits

- Faster iterations without full model rebuilds.
- Contextual accuracy tied to campaigns/periods.
- Scalable automation with clean pipelines.

## Case note: Beehiiv channel shifts

Time‑varying MMM + incrementality revealed TikTok outperforming platform metrics, while Meta’s true incremental cost was ~345% higher than reported.

## Self‑assessment

- Can your team explain recommendations?
- Have you validated with real‑world tests?
- Do coefficients change over time?
- Can you detect misleading platform metrics?
- Are budgets truly incremental?

## Next steps

If you’re stuck with a static MMM, integrate incrementality and upgrade to dynamic betas. If you’re evaluating vendors, demand causal validation and transparent time‑varying effects.
