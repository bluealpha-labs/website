# Why CFOs Need to Partner with CMOs to Reduce Waste in Marketing Spend | BlueAlpha

![Why CFOs Need to Partner with CMOs to Reduce Waste in Marketing Spend - BlueAlpha for CFOs](#assets/articles/cfo-cmo-reduce-marketing-waste/cfo-cmo-reduce-waste.webp)

As a CFO, you’re well aware of the increasing pressure to show the business impact of the budgets you routinely approve for marketing investments. [Research](https://cmosurvey.org/results/) by Duke University suggests that *up to 40% of marketing budgets* may be misallocated due to unreliable attribution data, representing hundreds of billions in potentially wasted spend across the global marketing industry. This disconnect between marketing and finance creates tension, as CMOs struggle to prove the value of their activities while CFOs demand more accountability.

The root of the problem lies in the way most marketing teams currently measure performance. They rely heavily on the tracking and attribution models provided by the ad platforms themselves, which tend to overstate the impact of digital advertising and ad interactions very close to the final sale. These models, biased towards “last-click”, give marketers an inflated sense of campaign effectiveness, as they over-attribute success to the final touchpoint before a sale, even if that touchpoint had little to do with the customer’s decision.

Compounding the issue, CFOs often lack a deep understanding of [marketing mix modeling](/articles/what-is-media-mix-modeling) (MMM) and [incrementality testing](/articles/what-is-incremental-marketing) – the more rigorous techniques required to isolate the true, causal impact of marketing investments. As a result, CMOs are hesitant to adopt these more advanced measurement approaches, fearful of the scrutiny and potential budget reductions that may follow.

This article will explore why aligning on incrementality measurement is crucial for driving marketing accountability and ROI optimization. We’ll provide a roadmap for CFOs to partner with their CMOs, leveraging data-driven insights to make smarter budget allocation decisions. By the end, you’ll understand how to translate these marketing measurement improvements into tangible business impact.

## The Limitations of Platform Attribution Models

As a CFO, you’ve likely grown frustrated with the superficial marketing metrics that CMOs often provide – things like impressions, clicks, or “conversions” rather then real sales. These metrics can look impressive on the surface, but they fail to capture the true business impact of marketing spend.

The problem is that the ad platforms themselves have a vested interest in making their advertising look as effective as possible. Their attribution models are designed to maximize the credit assigned to the final touchpoint before a conversion, even if that ad had little to do with the customer’s decision. This “last-click” bias inflates the perceived value of lower-funnel, retargeting-style ads, while undervaluing the impact of upper-funnel brand building and prospecting efforts.

On top of that, privacy regulations have been making it increasingly difficult for ad platforms to track the customer journey. Attribution models often rely solely on the last or second-to-last customer touchpoint because that’s literally the only thing they can “see”, leading to an incomplete and potentially inaccurate understanding of marketing impact.

As a result, marketing teams may be spending their budgets in ways that boost vanity metrics, rather than driving actual business growth. They may be over-investing in retargeting to existing customers, who were already highly likely to convert, while starving awareness-building campaigns that could attract new high-value customers.

### Why CMOs Are Hesitant to Adopt Incrementality Testing and MMM

While the advantages of adopting incrementality testing and MMM are clear, CMOs and marketing teams often hesitate to move away from conventional reporting and attribution metrics. This hesitation stems from several key factors:

- **Familiarity and Ease of Use**: Ad platform metrics are simple to access and understand, offering immediate feedback on campaign performance. They are deeply ingrained in most marketing teams’ workflows, making change a daunting prospect.

- **Perceived Complexity**: Incrementality testing and MMM require a more technical understanding of data, including the need to set up controlled experiments and statistical analysis. Marketing teams may feel they lack the expertise to implement these methods without substantial support.

- **Resource Constraints**: CMOs might see the adoption of new methodologies as costly, especially if it entails hiring data scientists or specialized personnel. For many organizations, employing a team of highly paid data scientists is not a viable option; these experts are often deployed to more critical, core business functions.

For these reasons, marketing teams frequently stick to the familiar: ad platform metrics and attribution models. Yet, as the best CFOs recognize, a more sophisticated approach is necessary to ensure marketing budgets are not only efficiently allocated but also truly effective in driving new customer acquisition.

## The Case for Incrementality Testing and MMM

### Understanding Incrementality and Its Role in Budget Allocation

Incrementality testing determines the true impact of marketing activities by measuring whether a customer would have converted without exposure to an ad. Unlike traditional attribution models, incrementality testing isolates the effect of marketing campaigns, offering a clearer view of ROI. For instance, with incrementality testing, marketers can discern whether a high-probability customer would convert even in the absence of advertising, thus guiding a reallocation of funds toward colder leads who require more substantial nudging.

In practice, implementing incrementality testing translates into:

- **Increased New Customer Ratio**: Incrementality-focused strategies lead to a higher ratio of new customers over total customers at the end of each reporting period, as funds are directed towards acquiring new leads.

- **Reduced Spend on Warm Leads**: Budget is conserved by reducing spend on customers with a high likelihood of conversion, even without targeted ads.

#### Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)

MMM provides a big-picture view by analyzing multiple marketing channels, adjusting for external factors like seasonality and economic conditions. While traditional attribution models focus on digital interactions, MMM encompasses all channels, both online and offline, providing a more holistic view of marketing performance. MMM can support CFOs in understanding the comprehensive return on marketing investments, allowing more data-driven reallocation across channels.

#### Incrementality Testing

Whereas MMM looks at historical trends, incrementality testing uses controlled experiments to measure the incremental, causal effect of specific marketing activities. This involves randomly exposing some customers to a marketing treatment (e.g. an ad campaign) and comparing their outcomes to a control group that doesn’t receive the treatment. The difference in performance between the two groups represents the true, incremental impact of the marketing investment.

Together, MMM and incrementality testing give CFOs and CMOs a much clearer picture of which marketing investments are driving meaningful business growth, and which are simply inflating vanity metrics.

### The Financial Impact of Incrementality Testing and MMM on Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)

For CFOs, customer acquisition cost (CAC) is a critical metric, affecting profitability and shareholder value. Incrementality testing and MMM reduce CAC by enabling smarter budget allocation. When funds are redirected from warm leads to cold prospects, marketing spend becomes more effective, ultimately decreasing CAC while increasing the new customer acquisition rate. Incrementality testing also offers the added benefit of reducing over-reliance on last-click touchpoints, which often exaggerate the impact of campaigns on customer acquisition.

As CFOs seek to optimize CAC, incrementality testing provides a data-backed approach to ensure each dollar spent on marketing contributes meaningfully to new customer acquisition.

## The Role of the CFO in Driving Incrementality Initiatives

#### Encouraging Accountability Among CMOs

In many organizations, marketing teams are not held to the same financial accountability standards as other departments. However, as CFOs strive for budget optimization, marketing expenditure warrants the same level of scrutiny as other investment areas. CFOs can lead this initiative by emphasizing the importance of transparency and data accuracy in marketing, positioning incrementality testing and MMM as essential tools for accountable budget allocation.

#### Building Familiarity with Incrementality Concepts

To facilitate this shift, CFOs themselves need to develop an understanding of incrementality concepts. Familiarity with incrementality testing enables CFOs to ask informed questions and collaborate with CMOs to ensure that marketing spend aligns with overall financial objectives. CFOs can advocate for solutions that allow marketing teams to adopt incrementality testing without the need for an entire team of data scientists.

## The Benefits of Adopting Advanced Marketing Measurement

Implementing a more rigorous, data-driven approach to marketing measurement may seem daunting, but the payoffs are significant:

- **Improved Marketing Accountability and ROI**. By tying marketing spend directly to incremental business outcomes, CFOs can hold CMOs more accountable for the impact of their investments. This allows for smarter, more strategic budget allocation, directing funds towards the highest-performing marketing activities.

- **Increased Marketing Efficiency**. Incrementality testing helps identify which marketing tactics are truly additive, versus those that are simply cannibalizing existing demand. This allows marketing teams to optimize their mix, shifting resources away from redundant or ineffective activities and towards the most impactful investments.

- **Better Customer Acquisition and Retention**. By understanding which marketing activities drive the most incremental new customer acquisition, CMOs can refine their strategies to attract higher-value, longer-term customers. Simultaneously, they can prioritize retaining existing customers through targeted, high-impact tactics.

- **Stronger [Finance-Marketing Alignment](/articles/cfo-cmo-relationship-issues-solutions)**. Adopting a shared, data-driven approach to marketing measurement fosters greater collaboration and trust between the finance and marketing functions. This alignment enables CFOs and CMOs to make more informed, cohesive business decisions.

## Implementing the Shift to Incrementality Measurement

We know what you’re thinking: “This all sounds great in theory, but how do we actually make it happen?” Here’s a step-by-step roadmap for CFOs to partner with their CMOs and implement a more robust marketing measurement framework:

- **Assess the Current State**. Start by understanding your organization’s existing marketing measurement capabilities. What attribution models are currently in use? What marketing KPIs are being tracked, and how are they informing budget decisions? Identify the key gaps and limitations in the current approach.

- **Educate and Align**. Bring your CMO and marketing leadership team into the conversation. Explain the limitations of platform attribution and the benefits of adopting MMM and incrementality testing. Emphasize that this is a collaborative effort – you’re not looking to usurp marketing’s decision-making authority, but rather to partner in a way that drives better business outcomes.

- **Pilot Incrementality Testing**. Begin with a series of carefully designed incrementality tests, focusing on high-impact marketing tactics and customer segments. Work with your CMO to establish clear test hypotheses, identify appropriate control groups, and measure the true incremental impact on key business metrics.

- **Integrate MMM and Ongoing Experimentation**. As you build confidence in the incrementality testing approach, start to layer in marketing mix modeling to understand the broader dynamics at play. Commit to an ongoing, iterative process of testing and optimization, with CFOs and CMOs jointly reviewing the results and implications.

- **Tie Insights to Budget Allocation**. Use the insights from MMM and incrementality testing to inform your marketing budget decisions. Shift resources away from activities that don’t drive incremental value, and double down on the high-performing tactics that produce the strongest business impact.

- **Measure and Iterate**. Continue monitoring the outcomes of your new marketing measurement approach. Track key metrics like new customer acquisition rates, customer lifetime value, and marketing-attributed revenue. Collaborate with your CMO to refine your strategies and maintain alignment.
