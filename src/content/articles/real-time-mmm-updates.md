> Executive summary

- Traditional MMMs take 3-6 months to update, missing 90% of optimization opportunities
- Real-time MMM systems update daily with 24-hour data lag
- Automated coefficient updates improve accuracy by 40% vs. static models
- Daily optimization captures 20-30% more value than quarterly reviews

## The quarterly MMM tragedy

Your current MMM process:

- Q1 ends March 31
- Data collection: 2 weeks
- Model building: 4 weeks
- Analysis: 2 weeks
- Recommendations: May 15

By the time you act, the market has changed 3 times.

## The real-time MMM architecture

### Data pipeline requirements

**Latency targets:**

- Platform data: <6 hours
- Sales data: <12 hours
- Complete dataset: <24 hours
- Model update: <2 hours

**Architecture components:**

```
APIs → Stream Processing → Data Lake → Model → Dashboard
  ↓         ↓                ↓           ↓          ↓
<1hr      <10min            <1hr       <2hr      Real-time
```

### Incremental model updates

Traditional: Retrain entire model monthly
Real-time: Update parameters daily

```python
class RealTimeMMM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_model = load_stable_model()
        self.recent_coefficients = {}

    def daily_update(self, new_data):
        # Update only recent period coefficients
        self.recent_coefficients = self.update_recent(
            new_data,
            lookback_days=30
        )
        # Blend with stable base model
        return self.blend_coefficients(
            self.base_model,
            self.recent_coefficients,
            weight=0.3
        )
```

## The sliding window approach

### 3-tier time horizons

**Tier 1: Real-time (1-7 days)**

- Simple regression
- No complex transformations
- Fast updates
- Directional insights

**Tier 2: Recent (8-30 days)**

- Full attribution modeling
- Saturation curves
- Lag effects
- Tactical decisions

**Tier 3: Stable (31+ days)**

- Complete MMM
- Seasonal adjustments
- Cross-channel effects
- Strategic planning

### Coefficient evolution tracking

```sql
CREATE TABLE coefficient_history (
  date DATE,
  channel STRING,
  coefficient_realtime FLOAT,
  coefficient_recent FLOAT,
  coefficient_stable FLOAT,
  confidence_interval FLOAT,
  significant_change BOOLEAN
)
```

Monitor coefficient stability:

- Stable: <10% daily change
- Evolving: 10-25% change
- Volatile: >25% change (investigate)

## Anomaly detection and auto-correction

### Statistical process control

For each channel, monitor:

```
Control limits = μ ± 3σ
Warning limits = μ ± 2σ
```

When breached:

1. Flag in dashboard
2. Investigate cause
3. Apply correction or exclude
4. Document for model learning

### Common anomalies and handlers

**Platform outages:**

- Detect: Zero impressions, normal spend
- Handle: Interpolate from surrounding days

**Tracking breaks:**

- Detect: Conversions drop 50%+ instantly
- Handle: Use predictive model until fixed

**Promotional spikes:**

- Detect: Revenue spike without spend change
- Handle: Add promotion flag to model

**Bot attacks:**

- Detect: CTR spike with no conversion lift
- Handle: Filter affected traffic

## The decision automation layer

### Trigger-based optimization

```yaml
optimization_rules:
  - trigger: marginal_roas_change > 20%
    action: reallocate_budget
    amount: 10%
    approval: automatic

  - trigger: creative_fatigue_detected
    action: rotate_creative
    approval: automatic

  - trigger: channel_saturation > 0.8
    action: reduce_spend
    amount: 20%
    approval: manual_review
```

### Budget pacing intelligence

Real-time pacing algorithm:

```python
def calculate_daily_budget(channel, remaining_budget, remaining_days):
    base_daily = remaining_budget / remaining_days

    # Adjust for day-of-week patterns
    dow_multiplier = get_dow_pattern(channel, today())

    # Adjust for efficiency trends
    efficiency_trend = get_efficiency_trend(channel, lookback=7)

    # Adjust for competitive dynamics
    competition_index = get_auction_pressure(channel)

    return base_daily * dow_multiplier * efficiency_trend / competition_index
```

## Integration points

### Platform bid management

Connect MMM outputs to:

- Google Ads Smart Bidding targets
- Meta Advantage+ budgets
- Amazon DSP optimization
- TikTok ABO campaigns

Update frequency:

- Efficiency changes >10%: Daily
- Minor fluctuations: Weekly
- Strategic shifts: Manual review

### Executive dashboards

Real-time KPIs:

- Current velocity vs. plan
- Efficiency by channel (24hr rolling)
- Optimization opportunities
- Risk indicators

Daily insights:

- Yesterday's performance
- Today's recommendations
- This week's forecast
- Action items

## The feedback loop system

### Prediction vs. actual reconciliation

Daily process:

1. Log yesterday's predictions
2. Measure actual outcomes
3. Calculate prediction error
4. Update model confidence
5. Adjust parameters if needed

### Learning accumulation

```sql
CREATE TABLE model_learnings (
  date DATE,
  learning_type STRING,
  description TEXT,
  impact_magnitude FLOAT,
  incorporated BOOLEAN,
  model_version STRING
)
```

Examples:

- "TikTok Tuesday spike consistent 8 weeks"
- "Meta efficiency drops >30% at $50K daily"
- "Email drives 20% search lift next day"

## Organizational change management

### Stakeholder adoption curve

**Week 1-2: Skepticism**

- Run parallel to existing process
- Show daily insights
- Don't push decisions

**Week 3-4: Interest**

- Share accurate predictions
- Highlight opportunities caught
- Small test decisions

**Week 5-8: Adoption**

- Increase decision frequency
- Show cumulative impact
- Expand access

**Week 9+: Dependence**

- Daily optimization norm

- Strategic focus shift

### Role evolution

- Analysts: 70% data prep, 30% analysis
- Managers: Quarterly planning
- Executives: Annual strategy

**After real-time MMM:**

- Managers: Weekly fine-tuning
- Executives: Monthly pivots
