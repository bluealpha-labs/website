> Executive summary

- Creative fatigue causes 20-40% performance degradation but often goes undetected for weeks
- Early warning signals include declining CTR slopes, audience overlap increases, and frequency threshold breaches
- Proactive rotation strategies can maintain performance 30% longer than reactive approaches
- Combine statistical detection with incrementality testing for accurate fatigue measurement

## The hidden cost of creative fatigue

Every creative asset follows a predictable lifecycle: launch, scale, plateau, decay. The challenge isn't preventing decay—it's detecting it early enough to act. Most teams discover fatigue only after ROAS has already dropped 30%+.

## Early warning signals: beyond basic metrics

### 1. CTR decay velocity

Don't just track CTR levels—monitor the rate of change:

- Calculate 7-day rolling CTR slopes
- Flag when slope turns negative for 3+ consecutive days
- Weight by spend to avoid small-sample noise

### 2. Frequency saturation curves

Plot incremental conversion rate by frequency buckets:

- Healthy: diminishing returns but positive
- Fatigued: negative returns beyond frequency 5-7
- Critical: negative returns at any frequency

### 3. Audience overlap expansion

As core audiences fatigue, algorithms expand targeting:

- Track daily new user percentage
- Monitor lookalike expansion percentages
- Flag when new user % exceeds historical baseline by 20%

## Statistical detection methods

### Change point detection

Use Bayesian change point detection to identify when performance fundamentally shifts:

```
- CUSUM algorithm for gradual changes
- PELT for abrupt breaks
- Prophet for seasonal adjustment
```

### Time-varying coefficients

Implement local regression (LOESS) on creative performance:

- Reveals performance trends masked by daily volatility
- Identifies inflection points before they're visible in raw metrics
- Adjusts for external factors (seasonality, competition)

### Cohort degradation analysis

Track creative performance by exposure cohort:

- Day 0 users vs. Day 30 users
- First exposure vs. fifth exposure
- New audiences vs. retargeted audiences

## The incrementality lens on fatigue

Platform metrics lie about creative fatigue. Use incrementality testing to measure true decay:

1. **Holdout refresh test:** Exclude 10% of audience from creative for 2 weeks, then re-expose
2. **Creative swap test:** A/B test fatigued creative vs. fresh in matched audiences
3. **Synthetic control:** Model expected performance without fatigue, compare to actual

## Proactive rotation strategies

### Portfolio approach

Never rely on single creatives:

- Maintain 3-5 creatives per audience segment
- Stagger launch dates by 1-2 weeks
- Rotate before peak performance, not after

### Refresh triggers

Automate rotation based on composite signals:

- CTR below 80% of launch week
- Frequency above 7 for 20%+ of audience
- CPM increase of 30%+ week-over-week

### Creative variations that actually work

Minor tweaks don't reset fatigue. Focus on:

- New opening hooks (first 3 seconds)
- Different value propositions
- Alternative visual styles
- Fresh talent/testimonials

## Platform-specific fatigue patterns

### Meta: rapid saturation

- Fatigue onset: 2-3 weeks
- Key metric: CTR degradation
- Solution: aggressive rotation, broad targeting

### TikTok: content freshness critical

- Fatigue onset: 1-2 weeks
- Key metric: completion rate
- Solution: native creative styles, trend integration

### YouTube: slower burn

- Fatigue onset: 4-6 weeks
- Key metric: view-through rate
- Solution: longer-form variations, sequential messaging

## Building a fatigue monitoring system

### Real-time dashboards

Track fatigue signals in unified view:

- Creative age vs. performance
- Frequency distribution shifts
- Audience overlap trends
- Statistical fatigue scores

### Automated alerts

Configure multi-signal triggers:

- Single metric: 30% degradation
- Composite score: 3+ warning signals
- Predictive: ML models forecast fatigue

### Integration with MMM

Feed fatigue adjustments into MMM:

- Time-varying creative effectiveness
- Decay functions by creative age
- Platform-specific fatigue parameters

## Case study: 40% ROAS recovery

E-commerce brand detected creative fatigue 10 days earlier using statistical monitoring:

- Identified CTR slope inversion before absolute decline
- Rotated creative while still profitable
- Maintained peak ROAS 40% longer than historical average

## Action items

1. Implement CTR slope monitoring today
2. Set up frequency distribution tracking
3. Create creative pipeline with 2-week buffer
4. Run monthly holdout refresh tests
5. Build composite fatigue scoring

## The competitive advantage

Teams that detect fatigue early maintain 25-35% higher average ROAS. The difference isn't creative quality—it's systematic monitoring and proactive rotation. Stop reacting to fatigue; start preventing it.
