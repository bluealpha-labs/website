> Executive summary

- Standard MMMs fail during seasonal peaks, mis-attributing 40-60% of incremental revenue
- Channel effectiveness varies 3-5x between peak and off-seasons
- Dynamic coefficient models outperform static models by 35% in seasonal categories
- Pre-peak testing determines true incremental impact during high-competition periods

## The seasonal measurement crisis

Every Q4, marketers make the same mistake: assuming channel effectiveness remains constant as spending triples. Your MMM says Meta drives 4x ROAS year-round. Reality: Q4 Meta ROAS drops to 1.5x while CPMs double.

## Why seasonality breaks your models

### Competition density changes everything

- Q4 ad inventory: -40% availability
- CPM increase: +150-200%
- Consumer attention: -60% per impression
- Conversion intent: +200%

Net effect: Same spend, 70% less incremental impact.

### Baseline vs. incremental shifts

**Off-season:**

- Baseline demand: 30%
- Marketing-driven: 70%

**Peak season:**

- Baseline demand: 70%
- Marketing-driven: 30%

Your marketing isn't suddenly working better—organic demand is carrying you.

### Attribution windows explode

Normal purchase cycle: 7 days
Black Friday cycle: 30-45 days

Models trained on normal cycles underweight early-season awareness campaigns.

## The time-varying coefficient solution

Static coefficient: βᵢ constant across time
Dynamic coefficient: βᵢ(t) varies with time

### Implementation approach

1. **Fourier decomposition**

```
β(t) = β₀ + Σ[aₙcos(2πnt/T) + bₙsin(2πnt/T)]
```

Captures cyclical patterns without overfitting

2. **Regime-switching models**

- Off-season regime
- Shoulder season regime
- Peak season regime
- Each with distinct parameters

3. **Gaussian process regression**

- Smooth transitions between periods
- Uncertainty quantification
- Automatic relevance determination

## Pre-season testing protocol

### 8 weeks before peak: Baseline establishment

- Run incrementality tests at normal spend
- Document true ROAS by channel
- Calculate saturation curves

### 4 weeks before: Stress testing

- 2x spend in test markets
- Measure efficiency degradation
- Identify breaking points

### 2 weeks before: Competition simulation

- Maximum spend in select geos
- Measure incremental impact at peak
- Calibrate model parameters

### Peak period: Execution + monitoring

- Apply pre-tested parameters
- Daily holdout validation
- Real-time adjustment

## Channel-specific seasonal dynamics

### Search: Intent amplification

- Branded: +300% volume, -50% incrementality
- Non-branded: +200% volume, -30% incrementality
- Shopping: +400% volume, stable incrementality

### Social: Attention scarcity

- Prospecting: -60% effectiveness
- Retargeting: -40% effectiveness
- Lookalikes: -50% effectiveness

### Email: Engagement fatigue

- Open rates: -30%
- Click rates: -45%
- Unsubscribe rates: +200%

### Direct mail: Counter-cyclical opportunity

- Digital saturation drives offline effectiveness
- +40% response rates during digital peak periods
- 2-3 week lag captures post-season purchases

## The portfolio rebalancing strategy

### Traditional Q4 approach (wrong):

- Scale everything proportionally
- Fight for expensive inventory
- Accept degraded efficiency

### Optimized seasonal approach:

- **Pre-season (60 days out):** Heavy brand investment
- **Early season (30 days out):** Shift to consideration
- **Peak (Black Friday week):** Harvest with retargeting
- **Post-peak:** Capture research phase for next year

## Competitive intelligence layer

Monitor competitor spend for true incrementality:

### Share of voice analysis

Your spend ÷ Category total spend = Expected share
Your sales ÷ Category sales = Actual share

If actual < expected, efficiency is degrading.

### Auction pressure indicators

- CPM relative to baseline
- Impression share changes
- Quality score shifts
- Frequency requirements

## Building seasonal adjustment factors

### Historical calibration

1. Isolate seasonal periods across 2-3 years
2. Calculate efficiency ratios vs. baseline
3. Model decay curves by spend level
4. Create channel-specific multipliers

### Real-time adjustment

- Daily efficiency tracking
- 7-day rolling adjustments
- Threshold-based alerts
- Automated bid modifications

## The holdout validation framework

Never trust models during peak periods without validation:

### Geographic holdouts

- 10% of DMAs zero spend
- Compare to predicted baseline
- Calculate true incremental lift
- Adjust model coefficients

### Audience holdouts

- Exclude segments from targeting
- Measure organic conversion rates
- Quantify incremental impact
- Calibrate attribution models

### Channel holdouts

- Rotating daily pauses
- Measure immediate impact
- Account for lag effects
- Validate cross-channel substitution

## Case study: Breaking the Black Friday myth

E-commerce retailer discovered:

- Platform-reported ROAS: 8.2x (Black Friday)
- Weather-adjusted baseline: 6.1x
- True incremental ROAS: 1.4x
- Optimal strategy: 60% pre-season investment

Result: Same revenue, 40% lower CAC.

## Automation requirements

### Data pipelines

- Hourly spend/revenue tracking
- Competitive intelligence feeds
- Real-time efficiency calculation
- Automated alerting system

### Model updates

- Daily coefficient recalibration
- Weekly regime detection
- Monthly seasonal adjustment
- Quarterly model retraining

## Your seasonal game plan

### Q1: Build infrastructure

- Implement time-varying models
- Set up holdout testing
- Create efficiency tracking

### Q2: Test and learn

- Run pre-season experiments
- Validate seasonal patterns
- Build adjustment factors

### Q3: Prepare for peak

- Stress test at 2-3x spend
- Measure saturation points
- Lock in strategies

### Q4: Execute and optimize

- Deploy tested strategies
- Monitor real-time efficiency
- Adjust daily based on data

Stop assuming seasonal performance. Start measuring it.
