> Executive summary

- Geographic lift testing (GeoLift) provides causal measurement of marketing effectiveness by comparing test and control regions
- Proper power analysis and holdout selection are critical for reliable results
- Integration with MMM creates a powerful feedback loop for budget optimization
- Common pitfalls include spillover effects, insufficient sample size, and confounding variables

## Why geo experiments are the gold standard for incrementality

Unlike traditional attribution models that rely on user-level tracking, geo experiments measure true incrementality by comparing geographic regions with and without marketing exposure. This approach sidesteps privacy concerns while delivering causal insights.

## The anatomy of a successful geo experiment

### 1. Power analysis: your first critical step

Before launching any geo test, calculate the minimum detectable effect (MDE) based on:

- Historical variance in your KPI across regions
- Number of test/control regions available
- Expected lift from the channel
- Test duration

Pro tip: If your MDE exceeds 30%, reconsider the test design—you're unlikely to detect realistic effects.

### 2. Holdout selection: art meets science

Selecting control regions requires balancing statistical similarity with practical constraints:

**Statistical matching:**

- Use time-series clustering on pre-test KPIs
- Match on seasonality patterns, not just averages
- Consider synthetic control methods for better matches

**Practical considerations:**

- Avoid regions with planned promotions
- Account for competitive activity
- Ensure sufficient geographic separation to prevent spillover

### 3. Test duration: finding the sweet spot

Too short: insufficient signal, high variance
Too long: opportunity cost, market changes

Optimal duration typically ranges from 4-8 weeks, depending on:

- Purchase cycle length
- Media flight patterns
- Seasonal factors

## Advanced techniques for better results

### Synthetic control methods

When perfect geographic matches don't exist, synthetic controls create weighted combinations of control regions that mirror test regions' pre-period behavior.

### Difference-in-differences with trend adjustment

Standard DiD assumes parallel trends. Add trend adjustment when regions have different growth trajectories pre-test.

### Bayesian structural time series

BSTS models capture complex patterns including seasonality, holidays, and external regressors—ideal for noisy, real-world data.

## Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### 1. Spillover contamination

**Problem:** Marketing in test regions affects control regions
**Solution:** Create buffer zones, use DMA-level boundaries, validate with placebo tests

### 2. Insufficient pre-test period

**Problem:** Can't establish stable baseline
**Solution:** Minimum 12 weeks pre-test data, preferably 26+ weeks

### 3. Multiple testing without correction

**Problem:** Running many tests increases false positive risk
**Solution:** Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction, use hierarchical Bayesian models

### 4. Ignoring heterogeneous treatment effects

**Problem:** Averaging effects across diverse regions masks insights
**Solution:** Segment analysis by region characteristics, use causal forests

## Integration with MMM: closing the loop

GeoLift results should feed directly into your MMM:

1. **Calibration:** Use geo test lifts as informative priors
2. **Validation:** Compare MMM predictions with geo test results
3. **Time-varying effects:** Update MMM coefficients based on recent tests
4. **Channel interaction:** Test combinations to measure synergies

## Automation and scale

Manual geo testing limits iteration speed. Build infrastructure for:

- Automated power analysis across potential test designs
- Dynamic holdout selection based on real-time data
- Continuous monitoring and early stopping rules
- Result integration into MMM pipelines

## Real-world success metrics

Well-executed geo tests typically achieve:

- 80%+ statistical power for 10%+ lifts
- <5% false positive rate with proper controls
- 2-3x faster iteration vs. traditional MMM cycles
- 15-30% improvement in budget efficiency when integrated with MMM

## Self-assessment checklist

✓ Do you run power analysis before every test?
✓ Have you validated parallel trends assumption?
✓ Are you testing for spillover effects?
✓ Do results feed into your MMM?
✓ Can you detect 10% lifts with 80% power?

## Next steps

Start with one channel in your most stable regions. Run a 6-week test with proper power analysis. Use results to calibrate your MMM, then expand to other channels and regions. The key is iteration—each test improves your measurement infrastructure.
