> Executive summary

- TikTok's view-through attribution inflates ROAS by 300-500%
- Synthetic control testing reveals true incrementality often 70% lower than reported
- Success requires TikTok-native creative, not repurposed Facebook ads
- Combine multiple measurement methods for accurate picture

## Why TikTok breaks traditional measurement

TikTok operates differently from every other platform:

- Passive consumption vs. intent-driven engagement
- Algorithm-first discovery vs. audience targeting
- Entertainment mindset vs. shopping mindset
- View-through heavy vs. click-through driven

Standard attribution models weren't built for this.

## The view-through attribution trap

TikTok's default attribution:

- 1-day click + 7-day view
- Credits ANY view over 6 seconds (or 100% if <6 seconds)
- No frequency capping
- Cross-device matching via TikTok ID

Result: Users who scroll past your ad and buy through Google get credited to TikTok.

## Real measurement strategies that work

### 1. Synthetic control testing

Build a statistical control using non-TikTok channels:

```
1. Model baseline sales from other channels
2. Launch TikTok in test period
3. Measure lift above synthetic baseline
4. Calculate true incremental ROAS
```

Recent results: TikTok true ROAS typically 30-40% of reported.

### 2. Geographic blackout testing

The gold standard for TikTok measurement:

- Select 20-30% of DMAs as control
- Run TikTok in remaining markets
- Compare relative growth rates
- Account for spillover effects

Key finding: 2-3 week lag between exposure and conversion.

### 3. Promo code attribution

Old school but effective:

- TikTok-exclusive codes
- Track redemption rates
- Compare to baseline promo usage
- Calculate incremental revenue

Captures only direct response but provides lower bound.

### 4. Post-purchase surveys

Ask customers directly:

- "How did you first hear about us?"
- "Which platforms influenced your purchase?"
- Weight responses by purchase value
- Calibrate against known benchmarks

Reveals TikTok's upper-funnel impact missed by attribution.

## Platform-specific optimization tactics

### Creative that actually works

**Native first:**

- User-generated content style
- Vertical video only
- First 3 seconds crucial
- Trend integration mandatory

**What fails:**

- Polished brand videos
- Horizontal reformats
- Traditional ad copy
- Static images

### Audience strategies

**Broad targeting wins:**

- Let algorithm find audiences
- Avoid over-constraining
- Test interest stacks carefully
- Leverage lookalikes sparingly

**Budget pacing:**

- Start with $50-100/day
- Scale gradually (20% weekly)
- Maintain 50+ conversions/week
- Don't pause campaigns

## The measurement stack

Layer multiple methods for truth:

### Weekly dashboard metrics

- Platform-reported ROAS
- Promo code revenue
- Post-purchase survey %
- Branded search lift

### Monthly incrementality tests

- Synthetic control analysis
- Time-series decomposition
- Media mix model updates
- Cross-channel correlation

### Quarterly deep dives

- Geographic experiments
- Creative incrementality tests
- Audience overlap analysis
- Long-term brand lift studies

## Integration with MMM

TikTok requires special MMM handling:

**Lag structures:**

- Immediate: 10-20%
- 1-7 days: 40-50%
- 8-30 days: 30-40%

**Saturation curves:**

- Steep initial response
- Quick saturation at market level
- Frequency capping critical

**Interaction effects:**

- Amplifies YouTube impact
- Competes with Meta for attention
- Drives branded search

## Common TikTok measurement mistakes

### 1. Over-relying on platform metrics

Platform says 6x ROAS? Divide by 3-4 for reality.

### 2. Short measurement windows

TikTok's impact peaks at 2-3 weeks, not 1-7 days.

### 3. Ignoring brand lift

Focus on direct response misses 40-60% of value.

### 4. Static creative

Refresh every 7-10 days or die.

### 5. Narrow targeting

Algorithm beats manual targeting 80% of the time.

## The profitability framework

Calculate true TikTok contribution:

```
Revenue attributed (platform) × 0.3 (adjustment factor)
+ Branded search lift × attributed revenue rate
+ Survey-indicated influence × average order value
- Total ad spend
- Creative production costs
= True contribution margin
```

Most brands find breakeven at 2.5x reported ROAS.

## Scaling sustainably

### Phase 1: Validation (Months 1-2)

- $1-2K/week spend
- Test creative formats
- Establish measurement baseline
- Calculate adjustment factors

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 3-4)

- $5-10K/week spend
- Broaden targeting
- Test new products/offers
- Run first geo experiment

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 5-6)

- $20K+/week spend
- Dynamic creative testing
- Audience segmentation
- Full MMM integration

## Your 30-day action plan

Week 1: Audit current attribution setup
Week 2: Implement promo codes and surveys
Week 3: Launch synthetic control test
Week 4: Analyze and adjust strategy

Stop trusting platform metrics. Start measuring real impact.
